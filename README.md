# WCA-Certificate-Generator
**WCA-Certify** is a Python tool for automating WCA competition certificates. It customizes certificates by adding names, fonts, and event logos. Using a template, Excel sheet of names, `.ttf` font, and SVG logos, it auto-places names (adjustable) and highlights participated event logos, simplifying certificate creation.
